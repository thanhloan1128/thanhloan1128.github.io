I am currently a PhD student at Clermont Auvergne University, in the LIMOS laboratory. Previously, I was a research intern at LRI (Inria – CentraleSupélec).

My scientific interests range from applied mathematics and computer science (on the theoretical side) to multi-objective combinatorial optimization (on the applied side). I am particularly interested in fairness, decision making, and reasoning. If you would like to discuss these topics, please feel free to reach out.
